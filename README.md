# Real-Time Chat Application (Socket.IO)

## Overview
This is a full-stack real-time chat application built to understand and implement WebSocket-based communication using Socket.IO. The project focuses on designing and handling real-time, concurrent user interactions while maintaining message persistence and secure access.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Realtime Communication: Socket.IO
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Features
- Real-time one-to-one messaging
- User join and leave notifications
- Online and offline user status tracking
- Persistent chat messages stored in MongoDB
- Media and file sharing support
- Secure user authentication using JWT

## Architecture
- Single-server architecture
- Socket.IO rooms for managing private chats
- Express and Socket.IO middlewares for authentication and event handling
- REST APIs for authentication and initial data loading
- WebSockets for real-time message delivery

## Learning Outcomes
- Clear understanding of WebSockets vs HTTP communication
- Hands-on experience with Socket.IO events and rooms
- Managing concurrent users in real-time systems
- Designing scalable real-time application architecture

## Project Type
- Personal project
